CDN

The dom tree in js goes to react.
then if any change occurs the firstly the change occurs in virtual dom in react and then change in real dom in js.

React and React Dom are separate.

React is used not only for developent




const listitem1 = React.createElement('li', {key:'li1', className:'li1', name:"Sparsh"}, 
                                                style:{
                                                        backgroundColor:'red'
                                                    }
                                             "Banana");
you can give any thing in {} in above line and it will add in element li in dom in js




We can render two roots of reaact in one single page




JSX -- 

Babel converts jsx  to react element.


Babel can be used without npm by directly using cdn link in script but we have to add type="text/babel" in app.js file.


const list = <ul>
                {
                    arr.map(a=>{return a})
                }
            </ul>
This is a react elelmet
